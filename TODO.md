# Premvkay — Build TODO

Living checklist for the whole app. Update this as work lands — check items off, add new ones as they're discovered. This is the source of truth for "what's left," independent of chat history.

Legend: `[x]` done & verified live · `[~]` partial / in progress · `[ ]` not started

---

## Foundation — done

- [x] Prisma schema — all core models (Album/Track/AlbumPurchase, Product/ProductVariant/Order/OrderItem, PaymentTransaction, BookingInquiry, GalleryImage, Event, User.activeDeviceId)
- [x] Nav/IA — dashboard shell (Super Admin/Admin/Manager) + public app shell (8 pages + Account)
- [x] Design skin — Premvkay amber/near-black palette, Cormorant Garamond/Inter, floating sidebar, floating mini-player

## Music — done

- [x] Admin: album CRUD, track CRUD, reorder
- [x] Public: browse albums, album detail, free/locked gating, real audio streaming via mini-player
- [x] Buy-album flow (records purchase directly — no real payment processor yet, by design for now)
- [x] Admin album-creation wizard (Metadata → Cover → Tracks, modeled on audiobookmasters' Studio pattern): multi-file bulk track upload with real XHR progress bars, filename-derived titles, real client-side duration detection (`Audio` + `loadedmetadata` — unlike audiobookmasters, which hardcodes duration to 0), native drag-reorder, staged-then-commit editing (rename/Free-toggle/soft-delete batched into one `PATCH .../tracks/bulk` on Commit). Shared `TrackStudio` component also used standalone on the existing-album Tracks page. Verified end-to-end live: created an album through all 3 steps with 2 real staged audio files (durations correctly detected), finalized to LIVE, then on an existing album exercised rename + Free toggle + reorder + delete all committed together in one batch call.

## Events / Gallery / Bookings — done

- [x] Events: admin CRUD + public upcoming/past split
- [x] Gallery: admin CRUD with reorder + public grid
- [x] Bookings: public inquiry form (on Contact page) + email notification to staff + admin triage (status workflow)

## File storage — done

- [x] R2 bucket created (`premvkay-record`), credentials added to `.env`
- [x] `s3.service.ts` implemented (presigned uploads), `/admin/uploads/presign` endpoint working
- [x] Real upload UI wired into Music, Events, Gallery (paste-a-URL removed)
- [x] CORS policy added via the Cloudflare dashboard
- [x] Verified end-to-end live: real file uploaded through the admin UI, confirmed in R2, confirmed rendering on the public Gallery page
- [ ] Note: current public dev URL (`*.r2.dev`) is fine for now; Cloudflare recommends a custom domain before production

## Merch — done

- [x] Admin: Product/ProductVariant CRUD with multi-image upload
- [x] Shared Orders/fulfillment view used by both Admin and Manager (`/merch-orders` API, `[ADMIN, MANAGER]`)
- [x] Public: browse, product detail, real cart (localStorage-persisted), checkout with shipping form
- [x] Verified end-to-end live: real product created, cart survived login, order placed, DB rows + stock decrement confirmed, both Admin and Manager see and can fulfill the same order
- [x] Sidebar/nav label: "Merch" → "Shop" (customer-facing `publicNav.config.ts`)

## Shop — pre-launch checklist (must resolve before go-live)

From a full api-to-web audit of the shop/checkout flow (2026-07-21), ahead of connecting PayFast.

- [ ] **Stock race condition** — `checkout` in `merch.controller.ts` reads `variant.stock` *before* the transaction, then decrements inside it with no re-check at decrement time. Two concurrent checkouts on the last unit can both pass and both decrement, oversetting. Fix: conditional update (`WHERE stock >= quantity`) inside the transaction, or serializable isolation.
- [ ] **Order confirmation + staff notification emails** — nothing fires today when an order is placed (mail.service.ts has invite/password-reset/booking-notification/verification-code emails, but no order receipt). Customer should get a receipt; staff should get notified the way booking inquiries already are.
- [ ] **Checkout → Google login loses the customer's place** — `cart/page.tsx`'s "Place Order" sends unauthenticated users through `/auth/google` with no return path; `googleCallback` always lands on `ROLE_ROUTES[role]` (homepage), not back at `/merch/cart`. Needs a `redirect`/`return_to` param threaded through the OAuth round trip.
- [ ] **"Merch" → "Shop" in the admin dashboard too** — customer-facing nav is done, but the admin sidebar link, the `MerchPage.tsx` h1, and the public product-detail page's `PageHeader`/breadcrumb (`[productId]/page.tsx`) still say "Merch."
- [ ] **Remove the password-reset flow entirely** — `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password` pages, their API endpoints, and `sendPasswordResetEmail` in mail.service.ts. Everyone but Super Admin is Google-only already; Super Admin's own login page is the only place `/forgot-password` is even linked from. Tradeoff to accept: if Super Admin ever forgets their password, recovery is a direct DB/script intervention (same as the original seed), not a self-service email flow.
- [ ] **Best-in-class product gallery/thumbnails** — current image gallery (`[productId]/page.tsx`) works (main image + thumbnail strip) but should be upgraded to match top-tier ecommerce product pages (larger primary image, smoother thumbnail interaction, possibly zoom/lightbox).
- [ ] **Delivery tracking** — physical merch is shipped; need to track whether an order has actually been delivered, not just "Fulfilled." Likely a schema change: either extend `OrderStatus` (e.g. add `SHIPPED`/`DELIVERED`) or add a `deliveredAt` timestamp + optional tracking number field, surfaced in both the admin Orders view and the customer's My Orders tab.

Open decisions (not broken, but worth an explicit yes/no before launch):
- [ ] Guest checkout vs. account-required — currently account (Google) required before ordering.
- [ ] Shipping cost — currently no separate line item; total is just sum of item prices. Confirm this is intentional (built into pricing) vs. needing its own field.
- [ ] Discount/promo codes, product reviews, catalog search/sort — all currently absent; likely fine until the catalog grows past a page or two, but flagging so it's a deliberate call, not an oversight.

## Admin — professional tooling (sidebar/analytics audit, 2026-07-21)

Current admin sidebar is entirely operational (CRUD on every entity) with nothing analytical — no way to see "how is the business doing," which matters given this is ecommerce + a Spotify-for-Artists-style streaming product, not just a content manager.

- [ ] **Analytics page (flagship addition)** — combine sales reporting (revenue over time, top-selling products/variants, average order value, revenue split music vs. merch, order-status breakdown — all derivable from existing `Order`/`OrderItem`/`PaymentTransaction` data) with listening analytics (play counts per track/album, most-played tracks, plays over time, and specifically which free tracks convert listeners into buyers). The listening half needs a new `AlbumPlay`/`TrackPlay` log or counter column — no play-count tracking exists in the schema today.
- [ ] **Low-stock visibility** — badge/filter on the existing Merch → Products table using the `stock` field that's already there; no new page needed.
- [ ] **Customer detail view** — clicking into a customer on the Customers page should show order history + lifetime spend, not just profile fields.
- [ ] **Packing slip / order export** — printable packing slip per order (name, address, items, order #) and a CSV export of pending orders, for physical shipping.
- [ ] **Feature an album on Sanctum** — admin toggle to control what Sanctum's "Up Next" surfaces, instead of a pure random pick; ties merch drops to the album promoting them.

Phase 2 / worth naming now, not launch-blocking:
- [ ] Payments/reconciliation view (settlement status, failed payments, refunds) — makes sense once PayFast is actually live, premature before.
- [ ] Discount/promo codes — no schema support today; revisit as the catalog grows.
- [ ] Fan broadcast email ("notify buyers about a new drop") — natural fit for a direct-to-fan platform, but a real feature, not a config toggle.
- [ ] Manager's sidebar is thin (Overview + Orders only) — revisit once Analytics exists, scoped down from the full admin view.

## Account page — done

- [x] API: "my purchased albums" + "my orders" endpoints
- [x] UI: real purchase/order history + profile — verified live for both a customer with purchases and an empty account

## Content management — done

- [x] Admin About/Contact/Harinam text editor (`ContentPage`), backed by the existing `SystemSetting` key/value store, own whitelisted module separate from Super-Admin platform settings
- [x] Public About page reads real content
- [x] Public Contact page shows real email/phone/socials alongside the booking form

## Content page (About/Harinam/Sanctum/Contact) — rebuilt (2026-07-21)

Audit findings from earlier the same day, all addressed:

- [x] **Save now only sends changed fields** — dirty-key tracking (`Set<keyof ContentMap>`) means `handleSave` only PATCHes fields actually touched since load, across however many tabs, eliminating the stale-data clobber risk. Button label shows the pending count ("Save changes (2)").
- [x] **Per-tab dirty indicator** — a small dot on any tab with unsaved edits.
- [x] **Unsaved-changes warning** — `beforeunload` guard covers tab close/refresh/typing a new URL. Note: doesn't intercept in-app SPA navigation (clicking a different sidebar link) — that would need wrapping Next's router directly; scoped out as lower-value than the tab-close case.
- [x] **Last-saved timestamp + one-level revert** — `SystemSetting` gained a `previousValue` column; every save stores the prior value, a new `POST /admin/content/:key/revert` endpoint swaps back. Not full version history, but covers "I overwrote this by mistake."
- [x] **Structured, clickable social links** — replaced the single free-text `contact_socials` field with five real fields (Instagram/YouTube/Facebook/X/Website), each rendered as a clickable icon link on the public Contact page (custom inline SVG brand marks in `shared/components/SocialIcons.tsx`, since lucide-react dropped brand icons a few versions back).
- [x] **Markdown editor image insertion** — new toolbar button uploads via the existing presigned-upload flow (`content` added to the allowed folder list) and inserts `![](url)` at the cursor.
- [x] **"View live" link** — jumps to the actual public page for whichever tab is open.
- [ ] Sanctum tab is still just a single quote field — still worth designing together with the "feature an album on Sanctum" item tracked above, deliberately not done in this pass since that feature doesn't exist yet.

## Harinam — done

- [x] Decision: reuses the `Event` model, plus one new `category` field (`GENERAL`/`HARINAM`)
- [x] Admin manages both from the same Events page (category selector added)
- [x] Public `/harinam` page built, `/events` filtered to exclude Harinam sessions — verified live, no duplication

## Bookings — rebuilt (2026-07-21)

Audit findings from earlier the same day, all addressed:

- [x] **Structured event date/venue/type** — new event-type list (originally a fixed `BookingEventType` enum, later made owner-editable — see follow-up round below) plus real `eventDate`/`venue` columns on `BookingInquiry`. Public Contact form has a real date picker, venue field, and type dropdown; `eventDetails` demoted to an optional "additional details" field. Legacy rows with no structured data degrade gracefully (show "—" instead of breaking).
- [x] **Reply from the app** — new `BookingReply` model + `POST /admin/bookings/:id/reply`; admin can type a reply in the expanded row, it emails the inquirer directly and the thread is visible going forward. Sending a reply auto-advances status out of NEW into CONTACTED.
- [x] **Auto-acknowledgment email to the inquirer** — `submitInquiry` now also sends a plain "we got it, we'll respond within 48 hours" email to whoever submitted the form, alongside the existing staff notification.
- [x] **Conflict visibility** — table has a sort toggle (received vs. event date) plus an inline "⚠ conflict" flag on any non-confirmed inquiry whose date matches an already-CONFIRMED booking. Verified live: confirming one inquiry and submitting a second with the same date correctly flagged the conflict.
- [x] **Private internal notes field** — per-inquiry notes textarea in the expanded row, staff-only, persisted server-side (verified surviving a hard reload).
- Also fixed in passing: the Overview page's "Needs attention" feed built its booking subLabel from the now-optional `eventDetails` field — would have shown blank for new structured-only entries. Now builds a proper "Wedding, 20 Dec 2026, City Hall"-style label from the structured fields, falling back to `eventDetails` for legacy rows.

### Bookings follow-up round (2026-07-21, later same day)

- [x] **Reply email confirmed delivering** — verified via a direct Resend API test (bypassing the UI) that `sendBookingReplyEmail` sends successfully and shows `last_event: "delivered"`. If a real reply doesn't show up in the inquirer's inbox, it's very likely landing in Spam (same root cause as the earlier invite-email issue — sender domain still building reputation with Gmail), not a code bug.
- [x] **Booking submission now requires Google sign-in** — `POST /bookings` moved behind `protect`; `email` is now taken from the authenticated session (`req.user.email`) instead of a free-text field, so it's no longer possible to submit a wrong/mistyped email. Public Contact page shows a "Sign in to submit an inquiry" prompt (same Google button used everywhere else) when logged out, and locks the email field to the signed-in account when logged in. Name is prefilled from the account but stays editable.
- [x] **Event-date field UX** — clicking anywhere in the date field now opens the native picker (`input.showPicker()` on click), not just the small calendar icon; the icon itself now follows the site's light/dark theme (`colorScheme` tied to `useTheme()`) instead of always rendering dark.
- [x] **Booking Settings tab (v1: fixed list, toggle only)** — new "Settings" tab on the admin Bookings page let the owner enable/disable which of 5 fixed event types were offered. Backed by `SystemSetting`. Superseded same day by the fully owner-editable version below once the owner asked to add custom types (e.g. Harinam) rather than just toggle a fixed list.
- Verified live end-to-end: submitted a real inquiry while signed in (email correctly matched the session, not a spoofable field); toggled Wedding off in Settings and confirmed it disappeared from the public dropdown, then re-enabled it; confirmed `colorScheme`/`showPicker` wiring on the date input via devtools. Test inquiry cleaned up afterward.

### Booking event types made fully owner-editable (2026-07-21, third round)

The fixed 5-value enum wasn't enough — the owner wanted to add their own types (e.g. "Harinam") outright, not just toggle a preset list.

- [x] **Schema change** — dropped the `BookingEventType` Postgres enum entirely. `BookingInquiry.eventType` is now a plain `String?`, storing the label text as it read at submission time (so renaming/deleting a type later never rewrites history). New `BookingEventTypeOption` model (`id`, `label`, `isEnabled`, `order`) replaces the `SystemSetting`-based toggle. One real historical row ("Katlego" / Wedding) was remapped from the old enum value to its human-readable label during the migration; the 5 original types were seeded into the new table so nothing visibly changed for existing users.
- [x] **Full CRUD API** — `GET/POST /admin/bookings/event-types`, `PATCH/DELETE /admin/bookings/event-types/:id`. Duplicate labels (case-insensitive) rejected; at least one type must always stay enabled (blocks both disabling and deleting the last one). Public `GET /bookings/event-types` returns only enabled labels, in order; `submitInquiry` validates the submitted label against that same live list.
- [x] **Admin Settings tab rebuilt** — each row now has an enable/disable checkbox, inline rename (pencil icon → text field → save/cancel), and delete (trash icon) with an in-app inline confirm — not `window.confirm`, which hangs entirely under browser automation and doesn't match the rest of the app's custom-modal style. Plus an "Add event type" field at the bottom. Every action saves immediately (no separate Save-settings step, since add/rename/delete are already discrete server calls).
- [x] **Public Contact form + admin table simplified** — dropdown now renders whatever labels the owner has configured directly (no more mapping through a fixed union type); admin Bookings table shows `eventType` as plain text.
- Verified live end-to-end: added "Harinam" as a brand-new type, confirmed it appeared on the public form immediately; renamed "Other" → "Special Occasion" and confirmed the rename propagated to the public form; deleted the test "Harinam" entry via the new inline confirm (no hang, unlike the old `window.confirm`); confirmed the historical "Katlego / Wedding" inquiry still displays correctly as plain text after the migration. Test additions/renames reverted back to the original 5 defaults afterward.

## Gallery — rebuilt (2026-07-21)

Audit findings from earlier the same day, all addressed in one pass, modeled on a reference design the client provided (albums sidebar, search, select-mode bulk actions, drag-drop multi-upload, hover controls):

- [x] **Real accessibility/performance bug fixed** — public grid, admin manager, and Lightbox thumbnails all now render real `<img>` tags with `alt` text (caption, or a sensible fallback) and `loading="lazy"`, replacing the old CSS `background-image` divs.
- [x] **Albums** — new lightweight `GalleryAlbum` model (freeform named collections, not tied to the Event calendar — matches the client's reference design, which showed generic names like "Kirtan Nights" rather than dated events). Photos with no album fall into "Uncategorized." Full CRUD, sidebar with live counts, filter-by-album on both admin and public Gallery pages.
- [x] **Bulk upload + native drag-reorder** — drag-and-drop multi-file upload zone (reuses the existing presigned-upload pattern from Music), real per-file progress bars, and native drag-and-drop reordering (same pattern as `TrackStudio`), replacing one-at-a-time upload and up/down-arrow clicks.
- [x] **Masonry layout** — CSS column-based masonry on both admin and public grids; photos keep their real aspect ratio instead of being forced into 1:1 crops.
- [x] **Select-mode bulk actions** — bulk move-to-album and bulk delete, in addition to per-photo edit (caption + album) and delete.
- [x] **Lightbox: swipe gestures + download/share** — touch swipe navigation, a download button (fetches as a blob so it forces a real download regardless of cross-origin headers), and a share button (native share sheet on mobile, clipboard-copy fallback on desktop).
- [ ] **Follow-up gap found during build, not yet addressed**: albums can be created and filtered, but there's no UI to rename or delete an album from the sidebar yet (the API supports both — `PATCH`/`DELETE /admin/gallery/albums/:id` — just no button wired up). Small, worth doing as a fast-follow.

## Anti-piracy / security — done

- [x] Single-device session enforcement — `/sessions/claim` + `/sessions/check`, polled every 5s while playing; verified live (second device claiming the account stops the first device's playback with a dismissible message, replaying re-claims)

## Payments — deferred, real work later

- [ ] Real PayFast once-off integration (replaces "record purchase directly" in both Music and Merch)
- [ ] PayFast sandbox credentials in `.env` (not present yet)
- [ ] ITN webhook handling

## Auth / accounts — done

- [x] Real Google OAuth credentials in `.env`, full flow verified live for both new and existing accounts
- [x] Single public "Continue with Google" button for everyone — customers auto-create as `USER`; invited `ADMIN`/`MANAGER` accounts land in their own dashboard on first login, `PENDING → ACTIVE` flips automatically
- [x] `/staff-login` removed entirely (along with the whole password-set-on-invite flow); Super Admin now signs in at a private, unlisted route (`/console-0726`) with a plain password form, not linked from anywhere in the UI
- [x] Password login hard-restricted to `SUPER_ADMIN` at the API level — verified a valid password hash on a non-super-admin account is still rejected
- [ ] Remove the password-reset flow entirely (see Shop checklist above — same task, listed there since it came up during that audit)

## Listener UI polish pass — done

- [x] Merch: `Product.category` (Apparel/Accessories/Books), public filter pills, professional product detail page (image gallery + thumbnails, variant pills, quantity stepper, stock messaging, category breadcrumb, related products row)
- [x] Account: rebuilt as tabs (Overview/My Albums/My Orders/Profile/Address), expandable order detail, real avatar upload (new customer-facing `POST /users/profile/avatar/presign`), saved default shipping address that prefills Merch checkout, visible Log out button
- [x] Gallery: iPad-style `Lightbox` component (thumbnail strip, arrow-key nav, prev/next), seeded 12 images
- [x] Events: public event detail page (`/events/[eventId]`), `EventCard` now links through, seeded more GENERAL + HARINAM events
- [x] Harinam: real structured content from the client's brief rendered via `marked` (Reasons We Chant, Who Is Hari, Who Is Gauranga, Duty, Śikṣāṣṭakam, Sankirtan, Harinam Cintamani, Prabhupada quotes)
- [x] About: editorial layout (hero + lede + `marked`-rendered body), richer placeholder bio
- [x] Contact: fixed dead-space layout (form/sidebar now properly fill the content width)
- [x] Fixed a real bug found during verification: `GET /auth/me` (used by `AuthContext` on every page load) had its own stale field-select missing city/country/language/dateOfBirth and all shipping fields — silently broke the new Address-prefill feature until fixed to match `/users/me`'s select


## Performance — pass 1 done (2026-09-20), keep improving

Goal: the site should feel native. Pass 1 measured first, then fixed the biggest costs.

**Done in pass 1**
- [x] Images: album covers were 2–3 MB PNGs shown as thumbnails. Now routed through Next's optimizer via `optimizedImage()/optimizedBackground()` in `apps/web/src/shared/utils/image.ts` (2.0 MB → 3.6/30/68 KB at thumb/card/large). `images.remotePatterns` in `next.config.js` MUST list every host we optimize; unknown hosts fall back to the raw URL so they never break.
- [x] Fonts: 15 files → 3 (Inter + Cormorant are variable fonts; dropped explicit weight lists in `app/layout.tsx`).
- [x] Public data cache (`apps/web/src/api/cache.ts`): stale-while-revalidate (fresh 60s, stale-usable 30 min, localStorage-backed) for content, albums list, gallery, events, merch list. Idle prefetch of all tabs in `PublicShell`. Admin writes clear it (`client.ts`). Never use it for per-user data (album ownership, orders, sanctum mix).
- [x] API `Cache-Control: public, max-age=30, stale-while-revalidate=300` on the public list endpoints (`middleware/cache.middleware.ts`); error handler strips it so errors are never cached.
- [x] Player: playback position moved to its own context (`useMusicPlayerTime`) so the whole app no longer re-renders ~4×/sec while playing; context value memoized; next-track preload (skipped when Data Saver is on); Media Session API (lock-screen/headset controls, cover art, scrubber).

**Next up — ordered roughly by payoff**
- [ ] **Audio start latency (biggest remaining).** Every m4a checked has its `moov` index at the END of the file (`ftyp → free → mdat → moov`), so each play needs an extra range request for the tail before audio starts. Fix is a lossless re-mux: `ffmpeg -i in.m4a -c copy -movflags +faststart out.m4a` — no re-encode, no quality change. Needs: re-mux all 29 existing tracks in the R2 bucket (overwrites production files, get explicit OK first; no local ffmpeg but Docker is installed, use an ffmpeg image), AND a plan for new uploads (admin upload flow currently sends the raw file straight to R2 via presigned URL, so new tracks will have the same problem — either require faststart exports, or add a processing step).
- [ ] **Server-render public pages.** Every public page is `"use client"` and fetches after hydration (HTML → JS → hydrate → API). Moving data fetching to server components with ISR (`revalidate` ~60s) puts real text in the first HTML for first-time visitors. ~9 pages: home/Sanctum, music, music/[albumId], harinam, about, contact, gallery, events, merch. Keep per-user bits (isOwned, sanctum mix owned/sampler) client-side.
- [ ] **R2 custom domain** (e.g. `media.premvkay.co.za`) — `*.r2.dev` is throttled and not edge-cached by Cloudflare; a custom domain gives CDN caching for every image and audio file. When done: add the host to `images.remotePatterns` in `next.config.js` AND to `OPTIMIZABLE_HOSTS` in `shared/utils/image.ts`, and existing DB rows still point at the old `pub-…r2.dev` host (either keep both hosts allowed or rewrite the URLs). Overlaps the R2 note under File storage.
- [ ] **Resize on upload.** Optimizer fixes display, but originals are still multi-MB in R2. Consider downscaling covers/gallery/merch images client-side before upload (canvas) or server-side, so the optimizer fetches smaller sources and storage stays lean. Also: uploaded cover/gallery/merch `<img>` tags have no `width`/`height`, so layout can shift as they load.
- [ ] **Gallery grid**: only `loading="lazy"` + optimizer today. Consider blur-up placeholders (tiny base64 LQIP) so the masonry doesn't pop in, and virtualizing if the gallery grows large.
- [ ] **Home/Sanctum backdrop** is an Unsplash placeholder; when real photography lands, self-host it (R2/public) at a sensible size and preload it. It's the LCP element on the landing page.
- [ ] **Player follow-ups**: verify next-track preload actually fires (couldn't observe it in pass 1 — the test track was last in its queue); consider gapless playback (swap to the preloaded element instead of re-setting `src`); a shared preloaded-element handoff; `playNext` currently re-requests the URL and relies on the HTTP cache.
- [ ] **API latency**: cold first request measured ~1s, warm ~0.4–0.5s TTFB from SA. Check the Railway API region vs Vercel region vs DB, and whether a keep-warm / pooled connection is needed. Baseline numbers (2026-09-20): music/albums 0.97s cold, content 0.46s, gallery 0.41s, events 0.48s, merch 0.47s.
- [ ] **Measure properly**: add Vercel Speed Insights / Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS) and Lighthouse runs on mobile, so the next pass is driven by real field data, not guesses. Pass 1 was measured with curl + the dev browser only; nothing was measured on a real phone.
- [ ] **Service worker / offline shell** (optional, later): cache the app shell, fonts and last-seen content so repeat visits are near-instant even on poor connections. Note `/sw.js` currently 404s in dev logs — something is requesting one.
- [ ] **Bundle audit**: run `@next/bundle-analyzer`; the public shell pulls in `marked`, lucide icons and admin-shared code — check nothing heavy ships to the landing page.

## UI polish — after the above

- [ ] Sanctum "now playing" real screen — currently an atmospheric placeholder even while a track is actively playing elsewhere on the site
- [ ] Full responsive/mobile layout pass
- [ ] Loading/empty state consistency pass across all pillars
- [ ] Accessibility pass
